I am an active and dedicated martial artist and have been for a majority of my life. I started training in Shotokan Karate when I was 8 and continued practicing consistently through high school, achieving my black belt in 2019. Once in University, I started practicing Wushu which is a Chinese martial art that focuses on fluid movements and acrobatics. I even joined the club team and have competed in several tournaments and became an internal coordinator for the team! I also love nature and the outdoors, I went camping almost every year until high school and recently went backpacking with childhood friends in Desolation Wilderness in California. This is partly why I am so passionate about using technology to try and help protect the environment that I love immering myself in.
