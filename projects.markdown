### Project 2: Planner
    An experiment I decided to do in a single sitting after I realized I forgot
    to buy a planner for the school year. This is a simple web application built with
    HTML, CSS, and Javascript that allows users to create, view, and manage their daily
    tasks and events in a clean and organized interface. There are known bugs but overall
    it functions as intended, and was one off project to practice my web development skills.
